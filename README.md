# Software_Interrupt_Test
 This repository was used to test the software interrupts on an STM32F334C8 microcontroller. The majority of this code was generated using STMCubeMx. The work I did was to include the EXT1_Init function to the main.c script as well as to add the REXTI1_Handler.h/.c files to handle the interrupt.
